I'm at PLDI 2025 right now, and try I'll post my notes and reflections here as I go.

# E-Graph stuff

There are a lots of cool e-graph things going on this week (none of which I was direcly involved in, very cool to see it all happening):

- Monday is the [egglog tutorial](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2025-tutorials/4/Unlocking-Optimizations-with-egglog-Equality-Saturation-Meets-Datalog). I don't think this is live streamed. The text version of the tutorial is [here](https://egraphs-good.github.io/egglog-tutorial/01-basics.html) (and on [github](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file)). This coincides with egglog's 1.0 release.
- Tuesday is the [EGRAPHS workshop](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/home/egraphs-2025)! This is in the Orchid room, and there are live stream links [here](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/attending/live-streams).
- Wednesday, the [Slotted E-Graphs](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2025-papers#) work will be presented in the PLDI research papers track. There is a full paper linked there, and I think all the paper talks are streamed/recorded as well.
    - This work has previously been presented at the EGRAPHS workshop and at the monthly seminar; cool to see it in the main PLDI track now.
