<section markdown="1" id="intro">

I'm an Assistant Professor in
[EECS at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).
My research aims to make program optimization
 more robust, powerful, and accessible.
Along the way, I use techniques from programming languages,
 databases, and systems.

Check out these pages for info on my current projects:

- The [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io) project uses e-graphs to 
  build new kinds of program optimizers.
  - See also the GitHub pages for 
    [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg)
    and [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog).
- The [EGRAPHS Community](https://egraphs.org/), 
  a community for e-graphs researchers consisting of a forum, 
  a workshop, and a monthly seminary series.
