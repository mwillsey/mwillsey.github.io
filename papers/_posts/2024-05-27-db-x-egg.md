Recent work in programming languages developed an approach to term
rewritings based on _equality saturation (EqSat)_, which,
instead of applying destructively the rewrite rules, maintains all
equivalent expressions in a structure called an E-graph.  This paper
describes two surprising connections between EqSat and databases,
going both ways.  On one hand equality saturation can be viewed as a
query evaluation problem, with great benefits.  On the other hand,
most sophisticated SQL query optimizers are based on the
Volcano/Cascades framework which, we explain, is a variant of
EqSat.
