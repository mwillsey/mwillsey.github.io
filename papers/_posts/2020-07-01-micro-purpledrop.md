## Abstract

Molecular manipulation and analysis are the cornerstone of life sciences.
With the recent advances in molecular data storage and computing, 
  it has become an increasingly exciting and viable alternative for the
  post-CMOS scaling era.
Widespread use of molecular manipulation/analysis and data storage/computing
  requires a scalable and low cost platform for hybrid molecular-electronics
  systems.
This enables us to build on the best of what molecular and electronics systems
  can each offer.
In this paper we present PurpleDrop, a full-stack digital microfluidic platform
  for hybrid molecular-electronic systems in multiple domains, and focus on
  DNA data storage as a use case.
We describe its design principles and relevant aspects such as closed-loop
  operation with computer vision and capacitive sensing, on-board magnetic bead
  extraction, and PCR, among other primitives.
Importantly, we emphasize the ability to express and execute protocols and
  computation that include molecular and computational components
