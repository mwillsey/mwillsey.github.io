## Abstract

We present egglog, a fixpoint reasoning system that unifies Datalog and equality saturation (EqSat).
Like Datalog, it supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning.
Like EqSat, it supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of optimized terms.

We identify two recent applications--a unification-based pointer analysis in
 Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter--that have been hampered
 by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa.
We evaluate egglog by reimplementing those projects in egglog.
The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems.
