## Abstract

DNA promises to be a high density data storage medium, but physical
storage poses a challenge. To store large amounts of data, pools must
be physically isolated so they can share the same addressing
scheme. We propose the storage of dehydrated DNA spots on glass as an
approach for scalable DNA data storage. The dried spots can then be
retrieved by a water droplet using a digital microfluidic device. Here
we show that this storage schema works with varying spot organization,
spotted masses of DNA, and droplet retrieval dwell times. In all
cases, the majority of the DNA was retrieved and successfully
sequenced. We demonstrate that the spots can be densely arranged on a
microfluidic device without significant contamination of the
retrieval. We also demonstrate that 1 TB of data could be stored in a
single spot of DNA and successfully retrieved using this method.
