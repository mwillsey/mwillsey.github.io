## Abstract

Concurrent C0 is a type-safe, C-like language with session-typed
communication that makes writing highly concurrent, message passing
programs easier, safer, and more efficient than other
languages. Concurrent C0 presents a novel interpretation of a
forwarding operation which allows channels to be combined in a
well-defined way. We provide C- and Go-based implementations with
language based optimizations that outperform traditional message
passing techniques.
