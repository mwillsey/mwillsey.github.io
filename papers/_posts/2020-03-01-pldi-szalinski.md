## Abstract

Recent program synthesis techniques help users customize CAD models
(e.g., for 3D printing) by decompiling low-level triangle meshes to Constructive
Solid Geometry (CSG) expressions.
Without loops or functions, editing CSG can require many
coordinated changes, and existing mesh decom-pilers use heuristics that can
obfuscate high-level structure.

This paper proposes a second decompilation stage
to robustly “shrink” unstructured CSG expressions into more editable programs
with map and fold operators.
We present Szalinski, a tool that uses Equality
Saturation with semantics-preserving CAD rewrites to efficiently search for
smaller equivalent programs.
Szalinski relies on inverse transformations, a novel
way for solvers to speculatively add equivalences to an E-graph.
We qualitatively evaluate Szalinski in case studies, show how it composes with an
existing mesh decompiler, and demonstrate that Szalinski can shrink large models
in seconds.
