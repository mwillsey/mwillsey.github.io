## Abstract

Over the last decade, worst-case optimal join (WCOJ) algorithms have emerged as
a new paradigm for one of the most fundamental challenges in query processing:
computing joins efficiently. Such an algorithm can be asymptotically faster than
traditional binary joins, all the while remaining simple to understand and
implement. However, they have been found to be less efficient than the old
paradigm, traditional binary join plans, on the typical acyclic queries found in
practice. Some database systems that support WCOJ use a hybrid approach: use
WCOJ to process the cyclic subparts of the query (if any), and rely on
traditional binary joins otherwise. In this paper we propose a new framework,
called Free Join, that unifies the two paradigms. We describe a new type of
plan, a new data structure (which unifies the hash tables and tries used by the
two paradigms), and a suite of optimization techniques. Our system, implemented
in Rust, matches or outperforms both traditional binary joins and Generic Join
on standard query benchmarks.
