## Abstract

Moore’s Law may be slowing, but our ability to manipulate molecules is
improving faster than ever. DNA could provide alternative substrates
for computing and storage as existing ones approach physical
limits. In this paper, we explore the implications of this trend in
computer architecture.

We present a computer systems prospective on molecular processing and
storage, positing a hybrid molecular-electronic architecture that
plays to the strengths of both domains. We cover the design and
implementation of all stages of the pipeline: encoding, DNA synthesis,
system integration with digital microfluidics, DNA sequencing
(including emerging technologies like nanopores), and decoding. We
first draw on our experience designing a DNA-based archival storage
system, which includes the largest demonstration to date of DNA
digital data storage of over 3 billion nucleotides encoding over 400MB
of data. We then propose a more ambitious hybrid-electronic design
that uses a molecular form of near-data processing for massive
parallelism. We present a model that demonstrates the feasibility of
these systems in the near future.

We think the time is ripe to consider molecular storage seriously
and explore system designs and architectural implications.
