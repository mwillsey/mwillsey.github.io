## Abstract

An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many
expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s
for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as
*equality saturation* repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art,
rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However,
e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality
saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require
adÂ hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely
syntactic rewrites.

This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and
extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized
invariant restoration technique called *rebuilding* takes advantage of
equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups
over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called *e-class
analyses* integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing
the need for ad hoc manipulation.

We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called
`egg`. Our case studies on three previously published applications of
equality saturation highlight how `egg`'s performance and flexibility
enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.
