## Abstract

We describe Concurrent C0, a type-safe C-like language with contracts
and session-typed communication over channels. Concurrent C0 supports
an operation called forwarding which allows channels to be combined in
a well-defined way. The languageâ€™s type system enables elegant
expression of session types and message-passing concurrent
programs. We provide a Go-based implementation with language based
optimizations that outperforms traditional message passing techniques.
